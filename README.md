## Overview

### The challenge

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive design
- Vanilla JS

  

### Continued development

I am continuing to learn how to implement and execute responsive designs for mobile devices.  I have noticed that this is not something many websites have in mind when developing, and with the push of developing a mobile app instead, it makes sense that for many companies this might not be a priority.  But for simple/basic webpages that a mobile application might not make sense for, I want to be able to provide clean and polished code/design.


### Useful resources

- W3 Schools - I used this resource to refresh my memory on certain CSS stylings, such as removing the default styling for <a> tags.
- stack overflow - I used this when researching different solutions to problems that came up with my styling.
- MDN Web Docs - I used this to help make sure I was implementing responsive design for smaller screens correctly.
